- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, we are the Gulf Research Institute for Highly Migratory Species.
- We are a group of marine ecologists at Texas A&M University at Galveston. Our mission is to fill data gaps in the habitat requirements, life history, and dispersive behaviors of highly migratory species in the Gulf of Mexico.
- Our institute comprises members of the Fisheries Ecology and the Shark Biology and Fisheries Science Labs at TAMUG, among others.
- Most of our researchers utilize R and GIS.
